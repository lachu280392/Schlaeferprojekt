In medical approaches OCT scans are used to image the uppermost layer of biological tissues non-invasively.
For the purpose of being able to investigate internal aeras of the body with this technique, researchers have developed 
OCT needles. 
One main reason for this attempt was that large surgical interventions can be avoided in many cases what 
results in smaller physical damages and faster healing proesses of the patients.
