%\Subsection{RNN}\label{sub:rnn}
      RNN model exhibit dynamic temporal behavior for a time sequence. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. Since we are predicting the force acting at the needle, it would be good to know the previous history of the force sensor value for the OCT data in order to predict the force better.
