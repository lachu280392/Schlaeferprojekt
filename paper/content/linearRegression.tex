% LINEAR REGRESSION %

%\Subsection{Linear Regression}\label{sub:linReg}

In \cref{subsec:feature_extraction} a correlation between depth at maximum intensity and force was noticed.
The scatter plot in \cref{fig:scatter_plot} further supports this assumption.
Hence, linear regression is supposed to explain the relation well.
A simple linear regression with the feature 'depth at maximum intensity' as the sole predictor was used.
The model fitted by ordinary least squares approach is depicted in \cref{fig:scatter_plot}
