\begin{abstract}
Content of this student project is to develop a model that gives 
information about the force acting at a needle tip while plunging it against 
a tissue.
The purpose is to give the operator some kind of force feedback
without measuring it explicitly.
Input of this model is an optical coherence tomography (OCT) signal
that is measured at the needle tip.
Three models which are linear regression, convolutional neural network
and recursive neural network are considered.
