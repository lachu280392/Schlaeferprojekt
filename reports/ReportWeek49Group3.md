# Project: Intelligent Systems in Medicine

*Status Report for Week 49*

Group 3: Felix Wege, Yuria Konda

## Phantoms

We will use four different kinds of phantoms:

* Silicon
* Gelatine (soft, hard) 
* Animal tissue (Kassler)

## Motion

We assume that movements in surgery are not linear or stepwise. Therefore we want to try random movements, however we would like to discuss this decision with a supervisor.

## Training and Testing

For training and testing we will do cross-validation by using three phantoms for training and one for validation.

## Models

We want to try four different models with different complexity, starting with the easier ones:

* Linear Model
* Random Forest Regression
* LSTM
* CNNs

## Tasks for the Next Week

On the 2017-12-15 we will gather data in the laboratory. Beforehand, some literature research on force estimation will be done.
